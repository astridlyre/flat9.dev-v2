            Hi! I am Erin, a self-taught musician and web developer based in
            Vancouver, B.C. I have been writing code for fun since 2005, and I
            have been programming as a free-lance developer since 2019.
          </p>

            <strong>Node.js</strong> and <strong>Native Web Components</strong>.
