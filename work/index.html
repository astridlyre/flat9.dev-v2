    <h2>fp library</h2>
    <p>
      A functional programming library, with various utilities that I use daily. It is
      <a
        href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ebflat9/fp"
        title="View fp on NPM package website (external link)"
        >published on npm</a
      >
      and the source code is available

        title="View the fp source code on GitHub (external link)"
        >on GitHub</a
      >. It includes implementations of <i>Observables</i>, like in the
      <strong>RxJS</strong> library, along with some
      <abbr title="Algebraic Data Types">ADT</abbr>s, utility functions and a simple
      reactive store, inspired by <strong>Redux</strong>.

    <h2>Zircus Apparel</h2>
    <p>
      I designed and implemented a full-stack solution for
      <a
        href="https://zircus.netlify.app"
        title="Visit Zircus Apparel Homepage (external link)"
        >Zircus Apparel</a
      >. On the front-end, I used <strong>Jekyll</strong> to produce a static site for
      strong <abbr title="Search Engine Optimization">SEO</abbr> and ease of
      Internationalization. In addition, I used <strong>Web Components</strong> to
      provided a progressive, enhanced user experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      The back-end API is written in <strong>Node.js</strong>, using the
      <strong>Express</strong> framework. It integrates with both
      <strong>PayPal</strong> and <strong>Stripe</strong>'s
      <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>s to offer multiple
      payment solutions, along with integrating with <strong>Canada Post</strong>'s older
      <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr>-based
      <abbr title="Representational State Transfer">REST</abbr> API for real-time shipping
      calculations and automated label-making.
    </p>
    <p>
      The back-end also includes a <strong>React</strong>-powered admin panel, written to
      enable Zircus Apparel to track their inventory and manage orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have experience with various JavaScript technologies, such as
      <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Vue.js</strong>, <strong>Node.js</strong> and
      <strong>Native Web Components</strong>. I am also confident with
      <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and
      <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>.
